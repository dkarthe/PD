  Keep your tunes wherever you roam

* Finding out how to transfer music from iPhone to Android may seem challenging, but there are a couple of methods allowing you to transfer your music in a simple manner, regardless of whether you're using Windows or macOS.

* On Windows, the process is pretty straightforward once your music is synced, while Mac computers require a third-party app like Google Play Music or Android File Transfer to sync your tunes to your Android device.

# Sync Music With iTunes

* iTunes can be really useful in this process depending on how you manage the content on your iPhone. If you already have all the music from your iPhone synced to your iTunes Library, you're halfway done.

* Otherwise, the first thing to do is sync your iPhone to iTunes to ensure all songs are in your iTunes Library. There are a couple of things to keep in mind if you need to sync the tunes in your iPhone to your iTunes Library:

  * Ensure you're using an authorized computer, as this will allow you to transfer all your purchases from the iTunes Store to the computer.

  * If your tunes were not purchased via the iTunes Store and they're not linked to your Apple ID, you can still use a third-party program to transfer music from your iPhone to a PC.
