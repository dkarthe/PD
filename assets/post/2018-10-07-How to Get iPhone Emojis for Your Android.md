`HTC or Android users, quickly update your old emojis`
* Even if you swear by your Android, you might still covet the emojis on your friend's iPhone. After all, they're pretty nifty. But while the emojis on Android devices and iPhones are technically the same, they have slight differences in design, and the iPhone emojis are really cool.

* The good news is there are cool iOS emojis for Android, too, and they're easy to set up; no rooting required. All you have to do is install an app and you'll be on your way with your fancy new emojis in no time. Here's how to get iPhone emojis for Android so you can join the emoji fun.

## How to Install an iPhone Emoji Keyboard on Android
* To get Apple emojis, you'll need to download an app that will enable you to install an iPhone emoji keyboard on Android. You have two options:

### 1.Choosing your own emoji app:
   A good choice for folks who feel very comfortable installing apps on their Android.
### 2.Trying out a popular emoji app:
   A good choice for people who'd rather try one app out and see how it works.
## If you want to choose your own emoji app:
1. Visit the **[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store?hl=en&tab=w8)** store and search for **"apple emoji keyboard."**
2. There are plenty of emoji apps out there to pick from, many of them free. Some of the most popular ones are Kika Emoji Keyboard, Swiftmoji, Facemoji, Emoji Keyboard - Color Emoji, and Emoji Fonts for Flipfont 5.
3. Pick the emoji app you want to use, download it, and install it.
4. Go to **Settings > Keyboard Settings**.
5. On most Android devices, you'll need to choose **Language & input**.
6. You'll see a list of available keyboards. Select the emoji keyboard you just installed.
7. You're done! Now you can use Apple emojis on your Android device.
## If you want to try a popular emoji app:
1. Visit the Google Play store and search for the **Emoji Fonts for Flipfont 5 app**.
2. Once you've found the app, download and install it.
3. Go to **Settings**, then select your **Display settings**
   * **Note**: On HTC devices, you may need to go to **Settings > Display and gestures** instead.
4. Choose **Font style**. Make sure you're able to change your fonts. Pick one font, then change it back to the default.
5. If that went fine, choose **Emoji Font 5**.
6. You're done! Now you can use **Apple emojis** on your Android device.

Note: You may notice the system font looks slightly different than it did before, but that won't hurt your phone. You should be able to use iOS emojis for Android without a problem.

You no longer have to be content with the emojis that came standard on your Android. Since you now have iPhone emojis for Android, you can have fun including these neat-looking emojis when messaging your friends, relatives, and colleagues who have iPhones.
