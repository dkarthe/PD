  Smartphone gaming has seen a sudden boost as most people prefer playing games on their smartphones.

* Game developers have also started making graphics intensive triple-A titles for mobile devices which also include the ported version of a few PC and console games. But there’s a drawback: not all the devices are powerful enough to provide smooth and lag-free gaming experience. Mid-range Android devices which are older than a year or two, they start showing their age while running some latest titles. In this how-to guide, we are going to tell you a few ways which can help you get the best out of your smartphone.
## 1. Close all the background apps and services
Apps running in background consume the maximum amount of RAM of your smartphone, which eventually hampers the performance. Closing all apps might give your smartphone an extra boost for gaming as games require more RAM and other resources to run smoothly.
## 2. Turn off Power/Data saving modes
Power savers and Data saving features are common for almost all the Android smartphones and they are designed to limit the overall performance of the phone. So it is advisable to turn them off before opening the game.
## 3. Enable High-performance mode (If available)
A few smartphone makers such as Samsung, Xiaomi, Huawei and Honor offer High-performance mode. This mode maximizes the CPU and GPU performance.
## 4. Use developers’ option to boost the game performance
By default, almost all the smartphone makers restrict a few settings to optimise the performance and battery life of their phone. This also limits the phone from rendering the games at maximum possible settings. However, this setting can be enabled using the ‘Developers’ option.
All you need to do is to enable ‘Developers option’ by going to Settings > About > and tap seven times on ‘Build number’. Once done, enable the ‘Force 4x MSSA (Multi-sample anti-aliasing) option. This option will allow your phone to run your games at the best possible quality. Note, this feature will drain your battery comparatively faster.
## 5. Use third-party performance booster apps
There are a few third-party apps available on Google Play Store which allow you to optimize your device’s performance and free up the maximum amount of resources from your smartphone for better gaming experience. Some apps also fiddle around with your device's settings to optimize them for better performance.
