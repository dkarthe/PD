* **PUBG Corp’s PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds** recently teased the inclusion of *map selection* in its next update, but now that the update log is out and the update has hit the *test servers*, it seems like there is a lot of new additions. The most important among the new features being introduced seems to be the *Rank System*, which will be ranking players in different tiers.

* The Ranking System will have different levels like *Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Elite, Master and Grandmaster*. This will keep the competitiveness alive and the help keep a track of the progress of the player as well. *Map selection is being added as well.*

* *Skin trade up* is another new feature in PUBG where players will be allowed to *trade in skins and Battle Points to acquire a skin of a higher rarity*. There is also a *new UI/UX* being implemented where the *throwables, consumables and emotes cam be controlled using wheels*. The devs are also bringing a network statistics function that will show *High latency, Latency variation, Packet loss*.
# Here are the patch notes of PUBG Update #22
## Rank System, Leaderboard, Region Renewal
* Server/region will now be decided automatically depending on the player’s local region
* If you group with a player from another region, matchmaking will automatically decide the best region to play on
* Implemented Rank System
* There are 8 total ranks
* Rank will be assigned based on Rank Points earned
* To earn your first rank, you will need to play 10 provisional matches
* Rank promotion / demotion will be decided by total rank points as indicated in the chart above

### Skin Trade Up System
* We’ve added a Skin Trade Up system where you can trade in items for those of a higher tier
* You can trade up multiple same-tier items and BP into one next-tier skin item
* Trade up requires ten items, and the maximum tier you can get is up to rare(blue) while the system is in testing. We’ll look to open up the system further once we’re satisfied with the balance of the system but please note that any BP costs associated with this system may change.
* The required BP amount is different depending on the tier of items being traded up. You will not be able to initiate the trade without all required items
