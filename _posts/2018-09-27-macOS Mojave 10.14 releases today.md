The macOS Mojave update brings bug fixes, performance improvements, and new features. Here’s everything you need to know.

* Apple unveiled the new macOS Mojave (10.14) update at WWDC 2018, earlier this year. Soon after the developer event, Apple also released the developer beta, which was followed by public beta a few weeks later. Now, Apple is all set to release the final version of the new macOS for the general users later tonight. Here’s everything you need to know about new features, how to download and install the update, and more.
## macOS Mojave compatibility

* As many as 7 Mac products will be compatible with the new software update. These include Mac Pros that were released in mid-2010, mid-2012, late 2013 and later. Mac Mini and iMacs that were released in late 2012 and later are also compatible. MacBook Pro and MacBook Air models released in mid-2012 and later, and all models of MacBook and iMac Pro are compatible with macOS Mojave. It’s good to see Apple supporting 6-year-old models that were released back in 2012.
# How to download and install macOS Mojave 10.14

* Before you go ahead and install macOS update, ensure that you take complete backup of your data. Once the backup is complete, head over to Mac App Store and then click on Updates tab. After the update is released by Apple, you should be able to see it on the top. Click on Update to download the OS, after which it will automatically install it.

* Alternatively, you can also click on the Apple Icon on the top left, click on About This Mac and then click on Software Update. This will again redirect you to the Mac App Store and prompt to check for updates. Once downloaded, you just need to follow the on-screen procedure for installation.
## macOS Mojave 10.14 top features

* Last year, with macOS High Sierra, Apple introduced features like Apple File System, improved video playback, new features in the Photos App, among others. This year, Apple has worked on making under the hood improvements to offer a smooth experience. Besides performance improvements and bug fixes, below are some of the features that you must try out on macOS Mojave.
## Dark Mode and Dynamic Desktop

* To being with, the company has finally added Dark Mode and Dynamic Desktop. Turning on Dark Mode turns your Mac’s Menu Bar and Doc dark, thus enhancing its appearance. For now, all first-party Apple apps such as Safari browser, Calendar, Messages, to name a few, support dark mode, and in the coming months, even third-party apps are expected to support the new mode.

* Apple has also added time-shifting dynamic wallpapers that changes throughout the day. This only works with wallpapers that come as a part of macOS.

* Let’s admit, a lot of us have the habit of downloading files and saving them on the desktop, to an extent where things look too cluttered. Organizing these files is a task in itself, and Apple wants to ease that with Stacks.

* You can now arrange the files based on images, documents, spreadsheets, PDFs and more. You can also group them as per date. To scrub through Stacks, use two fingers on a trackpad, and to access the file in the Stacks, simply click to expand.
## Quick Look

* There are times when you want to make changes to a file, which could be PDF where you want to mark up and highlight important points, rotate or crop an image, trim audio or video. You cannot do this without opening the files in an editor app. However, Quick Look simplifies the same.

* With Quick Look, you can crop images and PDFs, trim audio and video files, add signatures and do more without opening the files. It is a very handy feature. Say you have a photo and you want to crop it, you no longer need Photoshop or Photos App or something similar to do it.
## Screenshots and Screen Recording

* Apple has improved the way you capture screenshots and make screen recording. Now, when you click — Shift-Command-5 — a new menu appears at the bottom giving you new screen recording tools.

* You can take a screenshot of the entire page or select specific area. It is not something new as it was present before as well, but that used to be using different button combinations, now you get a menu at the bottom, letting you choose the specific task of your choice. Once the screenshot is captured, a thumbnail of the same appears on the bottom right corner with an animation. Apple has also added an option to record the screen, which is a new feature.
## Group FaceTime

* With iOS 12, Apple added the ability to make FaceTime video calls with multiple users at once, and now the same functionality has been added to the macOS too. You can now have a FaceTime conversation with up to 32 people at the same time. While this feature is coming to macOS, it will be enabled later this year.

* Besides this, Apple is also working on bringing iOS apps to Mac, and to begin with, Stocks, Home and Voice Memos apps are the first one to debut. The Mac App Store has also been designed with a much cleaner look and feel. There many other minor improvements, like phasing up 32-bit app support in favor of 64-bit apps.

* I have been trying out the macOS Mojave since the first beta rolled out and so far the experience has been good. Go ahead and try out the new macOS update, and let us know which features you liked and the ones you dislike, in the comment section below.
